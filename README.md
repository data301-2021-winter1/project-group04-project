## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

This dataset is available on Kaggle.com and was created by Jonathan Besomi, a data scientist from Switzerland. The data set lists nearly 1,500 different superheroes and gives each superhero an overall score based on traits such as strength, intelligence, speed, and power. The dataset also gives character background information, but for the purpose of our project we will not be using this information. This data set was created in 2020. Because of the nature of the data and it being based on fictional characters/fact, it was also likely collected in 2020. Our group was looking for a data set that would keep us engaged throughout the semester. Since we all have an interest in the marvel universe we thought that superheroes would be a fun topic to dive deeper into. We soon discovered there was more to learn than we could have thought which sparked our interest even further. This data set uses information from a separate database, however the creator has formatted and organized it in a way that users can export it, use it with github, etc.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words


We hope to see which superheroes would have scientifically made the ultimate avengers team. It will be interesting to see if any of the actual members of the Avengers team make it onto our overpowered team. 
We were originally drawn to superhero datasets because we share that interest. After searching within that topic, we chose this dataset because of the volume of superheroes analyzed in it. None of us were aware of just how many superheroes there are and we were curious why only a select few are considered mainstream.
Some questions we are interested in:

- Were the superheroes selected for the Avengers and/or Justice League truly the best superheroes?
- Who is the best female superhero?
- What is more important: brains or brawn?

Yes, we can absolutely see our group turning this into a dashboard. That is one of the reasons we chose this large dataset of superheroes. It is a topic we all have an interest in and we thought could look cool laid out in a dashboard.
